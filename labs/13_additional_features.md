# Lab 13 -  Additional Features

## Goal

The goals of this lab is to think of more ways how your application can be improved or extended. This is completely free format. Please do share with the rest what your ideas are!

Things you can consider include:

- Are there activities that can be done in parallel instead of sequential?
- What if the built-in retry mechanism is not enough? Can we make this even more resilient?
- How could you implement sending an email to 100 different persons instead of just 1?
