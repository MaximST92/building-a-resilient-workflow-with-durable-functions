# Lab 17 -  Additional Features

## Goal

The goals of this lab is to think of more ways how your application can be improved or extended. This is completely free format. Please do share with the rest what your ideas are!

Things you can consider include:

- How would you implement an approval procedure where two people need to approve instead of one? 
- What if the built-in retry mechanism is not enough? Can we make this even more resilient?
- How would you implement sending an email to 100 different persons instead of just 1?
