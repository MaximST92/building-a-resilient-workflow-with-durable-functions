# Lab 5 -  Storing the ProcessedNeoEvent

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to implement the activity which stores all ProcessedNeoEvent objects to blob storage.

## Steps

### 1. Adding a new class for the activity

Start by adding a new class, `StoreProcessedNeoEventActivity` , to the project.

Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage

### 2. Calling the activity from the orchestration


### 3. Build & run locally

Now run/debug your local Function App by using the [HttpTrigger client function](../http/start_orchestration.http).

Continue to the [next lab](6_send_notification.md) to create the activity which sends a notification.
