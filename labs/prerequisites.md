# Prerequisites

## SDKs & IDEs

Verify that you have a recent .NET Core SDK installed:

- .NET Core SDK (at least 2.1.701). Check with typing `dotnet --list-sdks` in the console.

Verify that you have an IDE with extension/plugins for Azure Functions:

- VS 2019 with Azure development workload
- VS Code with [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
- Jetbrains Rider 2019 with the Azure Toolkit Plugin

Although most of the labs can completely done locally it would be fun if you could deploy the Function App to Azure in final labs. For this you require [an Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
